# Overview 

The purpose of this project is to use Machine Learning algorithms to predict lithographic Vp values 

Vp can be defined as the ration of sismic ocmpressional and sheasr-wave velocities (Vp/V8) 

Sedimentary rock lithology can be implemented to predict which type of rock has hyrdocarbons

Use the following well logs 19A, BT2, F1B, and SR, from the well logs use all possible combinations to train with 3 wells and predict Vp with 1 well, evaluate the performance with parameter optimization for the machine learnign algoritms: 

* MLP (Machine Learning P)
* SVM (Support Vector Machine)
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest

Fromt he well log 19A we obtain the following data.
