# Overview 

The purpose of this project is to use Machine Learning algorithms to predict lithographic Vp values 

Vp can be defined as the ration of sismic ocmpressional and sheasr-wave velocities (Vp/V8) 

Sedimentary rock lithology can be implemented to predict which type of rock has hyrdocarbons
